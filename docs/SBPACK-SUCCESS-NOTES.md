# SBPack Deployment Success Notes

## üéâ Successful Deployment Achievement

**Date**: 2025-05-30  
**Project**: gdc-uploader deployment to CGC  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL**

## What Worked

### Key Discovery: Seven Bridges Credentials File
The breakthrough came from reading the [sbpack documentation](https://github.com/rabix/sbpack) which clearly states that sbpack requires a credentials file at `~/.sevenbridges/credentials` with the format:

```ini
[profile_name]
api_endpoint = https://api.endpoint.com/v2
auth_token = your_dev_token
```

### Implementation Success
1. **Automatic Credentials Setup**: Added `_setup_sbpack_credentials()` method that creates the file automatically
2. **Pure sbpack Approach**: Removed API fallbacks and used sbpack directly
3. **Proper Command Format**: `sbpack profile appid cwl_path`

### Successful Deployment Command Sequence
```bash
# Login and store CGC token
owlkit sbpack login

# Prepare workflow (no actual packing needed)
owlkit sbpack pack /workspaces/gdc-uploader/cwl/gdc_upload.cwl --output gdc-uploader-packed.cwl --validate

# Deploy to CGC project - THIS WORKED!
owlkit sbpack deploy gdc-uploader-packed.cwl szotcs/mp2prt-ec gdc-uploader-owlkit-test
```

**Result**: 
- **App ID**: `szotcs/mp2prt-ec/gdc-uploader-owlkit-test`
- **Status**: Successfully deployed and available in CGC
- **Verification**: Confirmed via `owlkit sbpack list-apps szotcs/mp2prt-ec`

## Technical Implementation

### Credentials File Management
```python
def _setup_sbpack_credentials(self, token: str, profile_name: str = "cgc") -> bool:
    # Creates ~/.sevenbridges/credentials with proper format
    # Uses configparser for robust file handling
    # Sets secure permissions (600)
```

### SBPack Execution
```python
cmd = ['sbpack', 'cgc', 'szotcs/mp2prt-ec/gdc-uploader-owlkit-test', '/path/to/workflow.cwl']
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
```

### Why Previous Approaches Failed

1. **API-only approach**: Seven Bridges Python SDK doesn't have the same app creation methods as the CLI
2. **Missing credentials file**: sbpack requires the specific credentials file format
3. **Wrong sbpack usage**: Initially tried to use sbpack for "packing" rather than direct deployment

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Read the documentation thoroughly** - the sbpack README had the exact format needed
2. **Use tools as designed** - sbpack is meant for direct deployment, not just packing
3. **Follow established patterns** - Seven Bridges ecosystem uses the credentials file pattern
4. **Test incrementally** - building up from simple commands helped identify the issue

### What NOT to do
1. ‚ùå Don't try to use Python SDK for app deployment without understanding the API
2. ‚ùå Don't assume "packing" means creating a separate packed file
3. ‚ùå Don't ignore tool-specific configuration requirements
4. ‚ùå Don't over-engineer when simple solutions exist

## Code Quality Improvements Made

### 1. Clean Implementation
- Removed complex API fallbacks
- Focused on sbpack-only approach
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- Added `test_sbpack_credentials.py` with 10 test cases
- Tests credentials file creation, updates, permissions
- Validates file format compatibility with sbpack

### 3. Documentation
- Created `SBPACK-DEPLOYMENT.md` with complete guide
- Updated README with real-world success example
- Added troubleshooting and best practices

## Verification of Success

## Integration with OWL Pattern

This success validates the complete OWL (Open Workflow Library) workflow:

1. ‚úÖ **Docker Image**: `ghcr.io/open-workflow-library/gdc-uploader:latest` in GHCR
2. ‚úÖ **CWL Workflow**: Validated and deployable CWL in `/cwl` directory
3. ‚úÖ **Deployment Tool**: `owlkit` provides unified interface
4. ‚úÖ **Platform Integration**: Successfully deployed to CGC
5. ‚úÖ **End-to-End**: Complete pipeline from code to production

## Impact

### For Users
- **Simplified deployment**: Single command deploys to CGC
- **Secure credentials**: Automatic credential management
- **Better UX**: Rich progress indicators and clear error messages

### For Developers
- **Reusable pattern**: Can be applied to other Seven Bridges platforms
- **Testing framework**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
- **Documentation**: Clear guides for troubleshooting and extension

### For OWL Project
- **Proof of concept**: Demonstrates complete workflow lifecycle
- **Platform integration**: Shows how to integrate with major genomics platforms
- **Best practices**: Establishes patterns for future workflow deployments

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ‚úÖ Update existing sbpack tests to reflect new implementation
- ‚úÖ Document the success in README and guides
- ‚úÖ Add deployment example to OWL documentation

### Future Enhancements
- **Multi-platform support**: Add support for other Seven Bridges platforms
- **Batch deployment**: Deploy multiple workflows at once
- **Version management**: Handle app revisions and updates
- **Integration testing**: Automated testing with actual CGC deployments

## Celebration! üéâ

This represents a significant milestone:
- **Complete end-to-end workflow** from development to production
- **Real deployment** to actual Cancer Genomics Cloud project
- **Unified tooling** that simplifies complex bioinformatics workflows
- **Reproducible process** that others can follow

The gdc-uploader workflow is now live and ready to help researchers upload genomic data to the GDC!
